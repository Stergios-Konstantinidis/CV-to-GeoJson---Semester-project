# Semester Project of Stergios Konstantinidis; spring semester at HEC-Lausanne MScIS

Example AR scenes that use [AR Foundation 5.1](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/index.html) and demonstrate its features. Each feature is used in a minimal sample scene with example code that you can modify or copy into your project.

This sample project depends on four Unity packages:

* [AR Foundation](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arfoundation@5.1/manual/index.html)
* [Apple ARKit XR Plug-in](https://docs.unity3d.com/Packages/com.unity.xr.arkit@5.1/manual/index.html) on iOS
